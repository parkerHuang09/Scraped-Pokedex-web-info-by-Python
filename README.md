# Scraped Pokémon Pokédex web information by Python

I am interested about pokemon when I was little, so I decided to scrape Pokémon information from website.

I do this project to help me  
1. Extract the pokemon related information, such as HP, Attack, Defense.
2. Extract "Where to find" pokemon in the pokemon game.
3. Caculate information for all pokemon, such as the average HP, attack point.

I used BeautifulSoup and Pandas to extract data on pokemon from https://pokemondb.net. The data will come both from the main database page, as well as the individual pokemon pages.
